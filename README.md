The primary aim of this project is to delve deeply into the weekly sales data of a bustling coffee shop to uncover underlying patterns and behaviors. By leveraging sophisticated data analytics techniques, we seek to dissect the nuances of weekly revenue fluctuations and customer purchasing behaviors. The ultimate goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their spending patterns and interaction frequency. This strategic segmentation will empower us to develop targeted marketing tactics tailored specifically to each customer group. By understanding when and how customers engage with our offerings, we can design personalized promotions, optimize our inventory management, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. This data-driven approach not only aims to boost the shop's profitability but also enhances the overall customer experience by aligning our services more closely with customer needs and preferences.
