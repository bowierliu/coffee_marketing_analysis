The goal of this project is to analyze weekly sales data from a busy coffee shop to uncover trends and customer behaviors. I aim to segment customers based on their spending and visit frequency, enabling tailored marketing strategies. This approach will allow me to optimize promotions and inventory, enhancing customer satisfaction and profitability by aligning services with customer preferences.
